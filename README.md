  - [x] Add switch to disable the Li-ion battery
  - [x] Add solder switch to charge / discharge li-ion
- [x] Gyro:
  - [x] Add separate 3v3 regulator
  - [x] Connect INT pin to MCU (give jumper)
  - [x] Connect AD0 pin to GND (the problem)
  - [x] Separate Q4 GND and GYRO_GND (in schematic)
- [x] GPS:
  - [x] Add many vias arround RF trace
  - [x] Do not cover antenna ground
  - [x] Fix eagle footprint problem, the un-shielded ground near every pins
  - [x] Add Matching Network between on-board Antenna and Solder-Jumper (for next optimization)
  - [x] Add solder jumper for TX pin between VCU & Ublox chip
  - [x] Connect V_BCKP to VCC (not VDD)
  - [x] Give jumper for GPS_IDD, it can use B+ or 5V from usb2serial
  - [x] Add recharge-able coin battery
  - [x] Use diode & resistor to limit current
  - [x] Increase C90 value to 100uF (tantalum)
  - [x] Use EXTINT pin to control Sleep mode
    - See section "9.3.2.7 EXTINT pin control" in "Receiver Description" datasheet
- [x] Fingerprint:
  - [x] Change Q6 from NPN to PNP
  - [x] EXT_FINGER_TOUCH_PWR change Collector trace from B+ to Vdd
- [x] SIMCOM:
  - [x] Add many vias arround RF trace
  - [x] Add Matching Network between on-board Antenna and Solder-Jumper (for next optimization)
  - [x] Remove R24 & R25, instead connect "LED_NET" directly to MOSFET's gate pin.
  - [x] Add MOSFET between INT_NET_RST (VCU) and RESET (SIMCOM).
  - [x] Re-swap the USIM_VDD and USIM_DATA pin.
  - [x] Change USIM holder.
  - [x] Change LTC output from 3.8v to 4.2v
    - [x] Give solder jumper to connect LTC or B+ (directly)
    - [x] then add MOSFET/PNP power control (used RUN pin) between B+ and VBAT
  - [x] Increase C42 value to 1000uF (tantalum)
  - [x] Move SIMcard related components closer to the SIMcard-holder
- [x] AUDIO:
  - [x] Connect pin 41 to GND (bellow the chip)
  - [x] Give GND hole (un-isolated) bellow the chip.
  - [x] VL & VP pin should use its own 3v3 regulator (so add it),
  - [x] and it must be controlled also using MOSFET or GPIO pin (directly)
- [x] Remote:
  - [x] Increase C91 value to 100uF (tantalum)
  - [x] Preserve on-board NRF chip
  - [x] Add uFL connector for on-board chip like GPS & SIMCOM
  - [x] Change the on-board microstrip antenna to v2
  - [x] Add Solder-Jumper (for next optimization) to switch between uFL or microstrip
